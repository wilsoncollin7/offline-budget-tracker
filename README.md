  This app allows the user to track their expenses even if there is no connection. The app will still function and store data if there is no internet, once a connection is made the data will automatically be sent to the database. :rocket:

  Here is the deployed app on Heroku: [Budget App](https://expenses-tracker-offline.herokuapp.com/)

  ```

  ## Usage

  This project uses an Node.js Express server and a service-worker to cache the files in the app. The database is Mongoose DB. Run:
